# Mandelbrot
## What is Mandelbrot
This project aims to create a de-centralised p2p server by distributed computing that can deliver and process webpage or media contents without a centre. As for the story behind the name Mandelbrot, Benoit Mandelbrot is the father of fractal geometr and this idea was inspired by his mathmatic thought of fractal geometry. I think the ideal Mandelbrot network should be every peer represents the whole network and the whole network represents every peer as well.
## Vision
This project hope to establish a network that can manage by the people who use it rather than a few big tech tycoons. I think it won'be be perfect at the start but I think we deserve some place to truely discuss and share our thoughts. 
## How to acheive this
I hope we can work together to develop the algrithem and coding.
